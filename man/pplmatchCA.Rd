\title{Match Canadian Parliamentary Debate Speakers to Member Records}
\usage{
pplmatchCA(Corpus, Names, max_dist = 0.15)
}
\arguments{
\item{Corpus}{A data frame containing parliamentary debates. Must include the
columns: `speaker` (speaker's name), `event_number` (a string that includes
a legislature number at the beginning).}

\item{Names}{A data frame containing parliament member records. Must include the
columns: `id`, `full_name`, `other_names` (optional), `party_id`, `gender`, and
`legislature_id`.}

\item{max_dist}{Maximum string distance allowed for a match (default: 0.15).
Lower values are more strict.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the original Corpus with additional columns:
  `legislature_num`, `legislature_id`, `speaker_clean`, `matched_name`, `party_id`,
  `gender`, and `name_source`.
}
\description{
This function performs fuzzy matching between speakers in parliamentary debates
and official records of parliament members. It uses the Jaro-Winkler distance
method to match names and filters matches by legislative period.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'debates' and 'MPs' data frames are loaded:
matched_debates <- pplmatchCA(debates, MPs, max_dist = 0.15)

# Check match rate
match_rate <- sum(!is.na(matched_debates$matched_name)) / nrow(matched_debates)
print(paste0("Match rate: ", round(match_rate * 100, 2), "\%"))
}
